Some planned enhancements to ipctest        Updated: 5/12/2013
------------------------------------        ------------------

Improve ipctest UI so it is clear if test cases are being created, edited or
run.  Allow drag-n-drop editting.  Add ability to group/ungroup function commands.

Implement ipctest client with Qt UI and a webappserver UI.

Make the non-gui client run in batch mode.

Add extensible commands via plugin in ipctest.

Make it easier to create new commands; maybe using class templates, helpers, etc.

Add SendFile, ReceiveFile commands

Support server-side testing
