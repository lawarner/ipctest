Some planned enhancements to ipctest        Updated: 6/9/2013
------------------------------------        ------------------

Improve ipctest UI so it is clear if test cases are being created, edited or
run.  Allow drag-n-drop editting.  Add ability to group/ungroup function commands.

Implement ipctest client with a webappserver UI.

Bring ipctest-qt up to par with ipctest-gtk.

Add extensible commands via plugin in ipctest.

Add commandline switches to ipctest-tui.

Make it easier to create new commands; maybe using class templates, helpers, etc.

Add SendFile, ReceiveFile commands

Support server-side testing (involves threading)

Decouple dependency on specific libraries, such as sockstr, expat.
